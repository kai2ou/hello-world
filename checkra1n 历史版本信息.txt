What’s new

This beta fixes multiple bugs, including:

An issue where the loader app would crash when installing Cydia on iPads
A crash when the macOS language was set to anything other than English
An issue where iPad Minis would not work with the GUI
An issue with the scp binary not working as expected
This version also improves clarity of some errors, specifically the -20 error, which now offers guidance on how to resolve it.
